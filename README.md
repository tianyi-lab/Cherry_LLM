This is the repo for the Cherry Data Selection project, which introduces a self-guided methodology for LLMs to autonomously discern and select cherry samples from vast open-source datasets, effectively minimizing manual curation and potential cost for instruction tuning an LLM.

The repo contains: 

- The cherry data used for fine-tuning the model, cherry_data_v1 represents the cherry data obtained based on the llama-1 model. 
- The model checkpoints that were trained using our cherry data.
- The code for selecting cherry data from the existing instruction-tuning dataset.

## Overview

Our study puts forth a method for autonomously sifting through expansive open-source datasets to discover the most impactful training samples. We coin these samples as "cherry data", designating those data fragments that hold the potential to exponentially enhance LLM instruction tuning. At the heart of our research is the hypothesis that during their preliminary training stages with carefully chosen instruction data, LLMs can develop an intrinsic capability to discern instructions. This foundational understanding equips them with the discernment to assess the quality of broader datasets thus making it possible to estimate the instruction-following difficulty in a self-guided manner. 

<p align="center" width="70%">
<a ><img src="images/method_overview.png" alt="overview" style="width: 50%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>
</p>

Initially, the model is familiarized with a fraction of the target dataset during the "Learning from Brief Experience" phase. This preliminary knowledge paves the way for the subsequent "Evaluating Based on Experience" phase, where we meticulously evaluate the model's response generation. To estimate the difficulty of a given example, we propose a novel metric called Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD) score in which both models' capability to generate a response to a given instruction and the models' capability to generate a response directly are measured and compared. By calculating Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD) scores, we quantify the challenge each sample presents to the model. Harnessing these insights, the "Retraining from Self-Guided Experience" phase utilizes cherry data with standout IFD scores to hone the model, culminating in our superior cherry models. The net result is a model that aligns more adeptly with instructions, ensuring enhanced performance.

## Highlights

* The selection of cherry data in this project is entirely self-guided and does not need ANY extra outside models, ranging from BERT to chatGPT.
* We use approximately 5% or 10% of the data to have comparable performances to the models trained on full data, which is experimented on the [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) and [WizardLM](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM) datasets.
* The IFD score proposed by us can divide the samples into better or relatively bad ones, which might provide insight into the types of data good for instruction tuning.
* **(Selective Reflection-Tuning)** The IFD scores and the reversed version can be utilized to construct better data! In [Reflection-Tuning Code for Selection](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Reflection_Tuning?tab=readme-ov-file#code-for-selection), we proposed the Teacher-Student Collaboration pipeline to construct a training set customized for the student. 
* **(Superfiltering)** The IFD scores calculated by LLMs with different sizes share strong consistencies! Thus you can utilize a really small language model like GPT2 to select the data for instruction tuning, which would be super fast and efficient! Please see [Superfiltering](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Superfiltering) for details.

### llama 2 models 

Thanks to the [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and [flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), we are able to run our experiments with longer length. <br>
The above results are directly using cherry_data_v1 for finetuning the llama-2-7B model, with the length of 2048, and using original vicuna prompts.

Note: WizardLM in the above table is our implementation using [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) code, prompt, and configuration. <br>
Note: Due to the hardware limit, all our models are using the 7B model. <br>
Note: For these llama2 models, we still use the cherry_data_v1 to ensure the effectiveness of our data. We will soon make the cherry_data_v2 which is based on llama2 available. 

## Data and Model Weights V2

In this section, all the IFD scores are calculated on llama2-7b or llama2-13b models by using Vicuna's prompt. The training of pre-experienced models is discarded for more efficient usage. The performances are promising in the llama2 model even without a pre-experienced model, indicating the proficiency of our proposed IFD scores.

All the above models are trained using [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) code and prompt. <br>
Data with IFD scores will be released soon. 

## Evaluation

We release the codes and data for using GPT4 or chatGPT to evaluate and compare the performance between two LLMs. This method greatly eliminates the potential position bias of GPT4 and chatGPT. For details, please see [AlpaGasus](https://github.com/Lichang-Chen/AlpaGasus) or our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12032). We thank [@Lichang-Chen](https://github.com/Lichang-Chen) and [AlpaGasus](https://github.com/Lichang-Chen/AlpaGasus) repo for sharing the evaluation codes.  

To use this code, please follow the below scripts:

```bash scripts/do_eval_generation.sh```: The model automatically generates the responses for a given instruction in test datasets. <br>
```bash scripts/do_eval_generation_wrap.sh```: Wrap the response files of LLMs being compared. <br>
```bash scripts/do_eval.sh```: Use GPT4 or chatGPT for the evaluation. <br>
```bash scripts/do_review_eval_score.sh```: Parse the results and draw the figure. <be>

More detailed illustrations will be updated. Feel free to drop me an email if you are urgent about it. 

## Performance Comparison 

Comparing our models trained on selected data with models trained on full data. (a) Comparison between our model with 5% Alpaca data and the official Alpaca model. (b) Comparison between our model with 10% WizardLM data and the reimplemented WizardLM model. (c) Comparison between our model with 40% WizardLM data and the official WizardLM model. All these experiments use GPT4 as the judge. Each horizontal bar represents a comparison in a specific test set.
